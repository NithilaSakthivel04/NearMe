    <hr>
    <center><h3>Yercaud 🌄🌿, often lovingly called “The Jewel of the Shevaroy Hills” 💎🏞️, is a serene hill station nestled in the Eastern Ghats, just 22 kilometers from Salem. Resting at an altitude of 4,970 feet ⛰️, Yercaud is a refreshing escape where cool breezes, rolling green hills 🌳, and aromatic coffee plantations ☕️ create a tranquil paradise far from the heat and noise of the city. Its name, meaning “Lake Forest” 🌊🌲, beautifully reflects the calm centerpiece of the town — the tranquil Yercaud Lake — where visitors can enjoy peaceful boat rides 🚣‍♀️ while surrounded by lush greenery. From the stunning views at Lady’s Seat 🌅 to the cascading beauty of Kiliyur Falls 💧, every corner of Yercaud offers a postcard-perfect moment 📸. The Botanical Garden 🌸, exotic orchidarium 🌺, and the hilltop Servarayan Temple 🛕 add layers of charm, spirituality, and discovery. Whether you're a nature lover 🐦, adventure seeker 🎒, or someone looking for quiet reflection 🧘, Yercaud invites you to slow down, breathe deep, and embrace the magic of the hills 🌬️💚.
