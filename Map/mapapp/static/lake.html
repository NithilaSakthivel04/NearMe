    <center><h3>Mookaneri Lake🌊🕊️, also known as **Kannankurichi Lake**, is one of Salem’s most beautiful and eco-rich landmarks. Located on the outskirts of the city, this rejuvenated lake has transformed into a peaceful haven for birdwatchers, nature lovers, and morning walkers alike. Spread across 58 acres, the lake is dotted with **47 small man-made islands** 🏝️ — each planted with trees and greenery 🌿 — creating a scenic and almost magical atmosphere, especially at sunrise or sunset 🌅.

What makes Mookaneri Lake truly special is its role as a **bird sanctuary** 🐦. It attracts over **169 species** of birds throughout the year, including migratory species like herons, painted storks, and even flamingos 🦩 during certain seasons. It’s not just a place to walk or relax — it’s a living, breathing ecosystem teeming with life and beauty.

The lake area also features a walking and jogging track 🚶‍♀️, benches, eco-park-style landscaping 🌼, and shaded spots for quiet reflection or casual chats. It’s especially popular with photographers 📸, fitness enthusiasts, and families looking for a calm outing in nature.

**Mookaneri Lake** is a shining example of successful urban eco-restoration 💧🌱 — turning a once-neglected waterbody into a vibrant green lung of Salem. Whether you're watching birds glide across the water, enjoying a quiet stroll, or simply soaking in the fresh air, the lake offers peace, beauty, and a touch of wild charm right in the city.
