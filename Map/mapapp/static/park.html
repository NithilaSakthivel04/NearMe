    <center><h3> Kurumbapatti Zoological Park 🐅🌿 is a hidden gem located at the foothills of the Shevaroy Hills, just about 10 km from Salem city. Spanning around **170 acres**, this tranquil zoo is one of the largest in Tamil Nadu and offers a peaceful escape into the wild for nature lovers and families alike. Surrounded by thick forests and rolling hills ⛰️🌳, the park is home to a variety of animals including spotted deer 🦌, peacocks 🦚, monkeys 🐒, crocodiles 🐊, and an array of colorful birds 🐦 that make it a perfect spot for both learning and leisure.

What sets Kurumbapatti apart is its natural setting — unlike typical urban zoos, the enclosures here blend with the environment, giving animals a more open and spacious habitat 🏞️. There are well-maintained walking trails 🚶‍♂️, shaded resting spots 🌤️, and even a small museum and educational displays for kids and curious visitors 📘👧. The zoo’s peaceful ambiance, with the sound of chirping birds and rustling leaves, makes it an ideal place for picnics, photography 📸, and quiet nature walks.

Whether you're visiting with children, exploring as a couple, or enjoying a solo retreat into nature, **Kurumbapatti Zoological Park** offers a calm, educational, and enriching experience that brings you closer to the beauty of wildlife and the serenity of the hills 🌿🕊️.
